  <p>As a designer, I believe that anything has room for improvement and I want to actively participate in ideating and implementing such advancements for products with social impact. Through internships with various tech companies, I've gained experience in product design, marketing, and management as well as business development. This summer, I will be interning at Microsoft as a Product Marketing Manager Intern on the Surface Team in Redmond, Washington. <br><br>

While the San Francisco Bay Area will always be home, I currently live in Ann Arbor as a senior at the University of Michigan graduating in December 2018. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in marketing and strategy at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business as well as a Bachelor of Science in Information with a concentration in user experience design through the School of Information. This dual degree provides me with a multidisciplinary understanding of product development, which is especially helpful with my pursuit of a career within the tech industry. <br><br>

For me, design is the driving force behind all businesses and products. When creatively and effectively paired with technology, it offers us innovative solutions and unforgettable experiences. I hope to be a part of a forthcoming generation that takes on the challenge of pushing the limits and applications of design even further.</p>
