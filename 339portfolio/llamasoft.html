  <div class='subheading'><h2>IN SHORT</h2></div>
  <div class='proj_desc'><p>In the summer of 2017, I was part of a 5-member scrum team that developed a map application for LLamasoft using the unique functionalities offered by the Mapbox API. The company was interested in transitioning from Bing to Mapbox as their map provider for its supply chain design software due to its advanced data visualization capabilities used by companies like the Wall Street Journal, Instacart, and Pinterest. Over the course of four 2-week sprints, we worked on this microservice that would "help a user better visualize their supply chain in order to help them utilize LLamasoft software to reduce costs or improve service." The ultimate goal was to build a web application that LLamasoft could use to evaluate whether Mapbox would be a worthwhile investment, leverage in contract negotiations, and bring its maps up to design and functionality standards given people's heightened expectation of web maps. I primarily served as the UX Designer and Business Analyst, so my responsibilities included requirements gathering, managing our Confluence/JIRA project management board, user research and testing, icon design, wireframing, and demo preparation. In the end, we were able to build an application that led LLamasoft to start the integration process of Mapbox into their product development plans for the near future.</p>
  <br>
  Since our application is still being used for negotiations with Mapbox, a public working demo is not available yet.

  <div class='subheading'><h2>USER RESEARCH</h2></div>
  <div class='proj_desc'><p>When this intern team project was proposed, there wasn't a concrete idea as to what the final product should be other than that it should utilize Mapbox. Thus, the given list of requirements were somewhat vague and typical for any mapping application, so one of my first steps was to flush out the given user stories by defining their purposes. These are some of the expanded user stories with their elaborated purposes <mark>highlighted</mark>:

    <ul>
      <li>As a user, I need to be able to display multiple sites on a map <mark>to visualize the layout of my supply chain.</mark></li>
      <li>As a user I want to be able to select a site on the map and get more info <mark>to further inspect locations that are impacting the efficiency of my supply chain.</mark></li>
      <li>As a user I want to be able to define more than 1 map layer and toggle visibility of layers <mark>to quickly switch between and compare various potential strategies.</mark></li>
      <li>As a user I want to view my sites on an isochrone map <mark>to evaluate critical distribution data through a visual/colored scale.</mark></li>
    </ul><br>
    This was needed to build a user flow, which would help as we began structuring our application and prioritizing feature implementation. Given our collective limited understanding about supply chain design, our team interviewed customer success members, consultants, and product managers within the company to get a better idea of how supply chain designers currently use maps. I also critiqued LLamasoft's existing interactive map in Supply Chain Guru X by sketching out and analyzing its UI for flow inconsistencies as well as unintuitive functionalities. This gave me a good baseline to start designing from since it helped me understand the standardized LLamasoft map elements that needed to be carried over into the new application. It also was an opportunity to identify areas of improvement, which we could then be wary of when designing our new application.<br><br>

    From all of this, I could then think about how data visualization techniques could add greater value to supply chain designer's analytical experience. This basic understanding was ultimately necessary before we could implement the more advanced Mapbox functionalities to create compelling use cases.
